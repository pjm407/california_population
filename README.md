# California Population

## Task - 
Calculate annual California population between 1990 and 2019 by race for ages 15 - 24 (or 18 - 25).

## Data - 

   - CDC (1990 - 2019): https://wonder.cdc.gov/Bridged-Race-v2019.HTML
        - Ages 15 - 24
        - No "Other" race category
    
   - ACS (2000 - 2018)
        - Ages 18 - 25
        - No annual 1990s data available before 2000
   
   - Census (1990 - 1999): https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/intercensal-1990-2000-state-and-county-characteristics.html

## Methodology - 

The CDC data employ bridge race estimates in their definitions of race and ethnicity. In 1997, the Census adopted new standards implemented by the Office of Management and Budget for how survey respondents indicate their race and ethnicity, specifically, if respondents can select multiple race categories in their response. This inhibits comparability to some extent between certain surveys across years with regard to different definitions and categories of race. As a solution, bridge race estimates were established to translate different census definitions of race across different years.
